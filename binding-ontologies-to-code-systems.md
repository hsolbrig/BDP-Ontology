# Binding Ontologies & Coding systems to Electronic Health Records and Messages
https://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~rector/papers/Terminology-binding-final-revision-embedded-single-rector%20copy.pdf

## Introduction
> "We contend that electronic healthcare records and messages are data  
> structures and refer to their models as “information models”.  By contrast,  
> we contend that the model of meaning or “ontology” is a model of our  
> conceptualisation of the world – of patients, their illnesses,  
> treatments, etc.  The function of the information models is to make  
> it possible to specify and test the validity of data structures –i.e.  
> whether or not they conform the their specifications – so that they can be  
> exchanged and re-used in different information systems.  The function of  
> the model of meaning to represent accurately our understanding of the  
> world so that we can reason soundly about the world in general or individual patients and their diseases in particular.  Validity neither requires or guarantees accuracy and soundness, nor vice versa. "
